Lab 2: Control Flow
Samantha Rack

Part 3 of the Lab produces a ASCII Art graph of the function 
y = 1.5*x*cos(1.5^x) + 15 for x = 2.0 to x = 8.0.  The user does not provide
any input for the program to run.  When the program is run, the user is 
presented with a table of values of x and y, and the production of ASCII Art
in the final column.  The user is able to find a y value for a given x between
2.0 and 8.0, observe the behavior of the function in the third column, and
read the maximum and minimum given below the table.
Internally, the program uses a for loop to print each value of x, calculate 
and print the corresponding y value, and print the portion of the graph for
each line.  In order to evaluate the max and min, the program compares the
y value calculated to the other y values that have been calculated during 
previous times through the for loop.  If the current y value is greater than
the previous max or less than the previous min, then that y value replaces
those values.  In order to print the correct number of #'s, a for loop is used
that decrements the calculated y value.  Each time through the loop, a # is
printed.  Once the y value is less than 0, the loop discontinues, and enough
#'s have been printed to correspond to the whole number portion of the 
calculated y.
The output of the program was verified by comparing the function's outputs
with the values and graph generated by a calculator for the given domain
of x values.
