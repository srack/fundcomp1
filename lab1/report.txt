	The program created for Part 3 : Custom Calculator of Lab 1 calculates 
where a ball would land after being thrown.  The user is asked to input the
height (with respect to the ground) at which the arm releases the ball, the 
upward angle of projection of the ball, and the velocity of the ball at 
release.  The output is the distance away the ball would land, given the 
specifications.
	The program is structured to request and receive the inputs of the user 
using printf and scanf, check that the values are valid for the problem using
if statements, calculate the needed values using projectile mechanics, and 
display the results to the user.
	The program was checked for correctness by using a calculator and the 
mechanics equations to evaluate arbitrary possible situations.  The program
was verified to produce correct answers at extreme values (arm height = 0, 
velocity = 0, angle = 0 and angle = 90), as well as at chosen, feasible 
situations (ie. arm height = 2 m, velocity = 3 m/s, and angle = 45 degrees).
